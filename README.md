# Expert C Programming Challenges

This repository contains my personal solutions to programming challenges inspired by the book  
**_Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets_** by Peter van der Linden.

## About the Book

Originally published in 1994, this book dives deep into quirky and fascinating behaviors of the C language.  
It offers real-world lessons, tricky edge cases, and fun low-level puzzles that go beyond basic C knowledge.

## Purpose of This Repo

I found a copy of the book in a resale bookstore and thought it would be fun and educational to work through the challenges using modern tools and techniques. This project serves to:
- Reinforce my C programming skills
- Document what I’ve learned from each challenge
- Share solutions for others interested in similar learning

> **Note:** This is an independent project. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the author or publisher.

## How It's Organized

Each folder or file represents a different challenge. I’ve included:
- The source code (`.c`) for each challenge
- Comments explaining the solution or edge cases
- Occasional `README.md` notes per challenge if needed

## Still in Progress

I'm working through the book at my own pace and will update this repo over time.
